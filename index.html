			<p>Situated at the crossroads of computational politics and intellectual history, this project uses a natural language processing model trained on a large database of speeches from Prime Ministers since 1946 to generate analytically intelligible answers to a much-debated question: what is the idea of India? Building on Khilnani’s account on the inclusive and modernist endeavour of the makers of postcolonial India, this text revisits the argument by contrasting Jawaharlal Nehru’s emphasis on diversity with Narendra Modi’s stress on unity. We argue that the gradual political deepening of the Hindu nationalist project in the country durably amends the state-sponsored idea of India. The article further discusses the epistemic status of ‘human’ insights derived from machine learning outputs. We outline five potential methodological aides of the automated approach to historical inquiry. Despite the fuzziness of model-generated texts, we insist on the hermeneutical usefulness of ‘political spectres’ in facilitating the identification of historical shifts in the representation of nationhood.</p>

			<p>The idea of an artificial, or a non-human general intelligence is certainly a fascinating one. On one hand, it is an exciting thought, to have another being which we command and can use to advance our quality of life. But on the other, it is also quite unnerving, and perhaps frightening to have a being of such capabilities exist alongside ours. Luckily, at least for the foreseeable future, we won’t have to weigh up whether to be excited or fearful, as such a scenario won’t exist for a while. What we do have right now, are beings of singular intelligence, which are highly programmable and limited in their capabilities. Usually called machine learning, they may also be mistakenly called Artificial Intelligence. I prefer to reserve the term Artificial Intelligence for a being with actual general intelligence. Of the numerous capabilities of contemporary machine learning algorithms, I have a deep interest in those which work with written text. Language is a highly programmable phenomena, but the use of language is also very distinct and is very different between any two people. The difference may be small and miniscule, but it is possible to tell the difference.</p>
			
			<p>If one were to learn the way someone speaks, and emulate their vocabulary, it may almost be possible to assume the identity of the author. This idea has been explored over and over again through the ages, sometimes for nefarious purposes. But now that we have access to machine learning algorithms, this process of emulating an individual's writing can be matched with further analysis of the content of the text itself, which could lead to the emulation of that individual itself. Written content encapsulates not only vocabulary, grammar, and tone, but also the content and traces of thought and intelligence. It could take someone years to find these traces of thought of intelligence replicate them. But for a machine learning algorithm possessing a singular intelligence and capability to work with text, this process could take mere hours to complete. This idea has been explored in the recent past, with efforts made by machine learning algorithms to emulate a deceased person, and allow for their loved ones to chat and communicate with a version of their persona created from a repository of their emails, letters, messages and collected writings. With time and technological advancement, the intelligence and power of these algorithms have only not only grown, but have become more accessible as well.</p>
			
			<p>One of the key organisations in this field is OpenAI, which has developed the GPT-2 machine learning algorithm. The fully developed version of GPT-2 is allegedly too dangerous to be made available to the general public, in fear that someone could weaponise such technologies for nefarious purposes. However, OpenAI has created semi-skimmed versions of GPT-2 available for download and use. We have used a lighter variant of the algorithm, the GPT-2 355M model to train on the corpus of collected writings from Indian Prime Ministers, past and present. As a proof of concept, these models are lightly trained, for approximately 2000 steps each. After training, each model was given the prompt of “My idea of India” and “The Idea of India” to receive responses. We chose this particular phrase as we felt it was a provocation that would be relevant across time, and help us understand the thoughts of each Prime Minister of India.</p>
			
			<p>This study has a long way to go, as we wish to train the models further (upto 40,000 steps), and conduct a more in-depth analysis of the results. Although it may seem trivial, and amusing even to read such texts, we feel it is important that research be made accessible to all, and adapt to an ever changing media landscape. This method helps keep the research process highly dynamic, and accessible, as we eventually hope to make the models publicly available and interactive, to let viewers ask their own questions to the Prime Ministers. This serves as a hook, to invite viewers to look at semantic analysis of the text and discover layers of hidden meaning behind the words.</p>

			<p>This project has been conceptualised and created in late 2019, and is currently in development. We're looking for partners to work with to exhibit the project and further develop the machine learning models.</p>
